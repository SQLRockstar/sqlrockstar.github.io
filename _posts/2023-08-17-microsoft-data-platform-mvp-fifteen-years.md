<p>I am happy, honored, and humbled to receive the Microsoft Data Platform MVP award for the fifteenth (15th) straight year.</p>   <p>Receiving the MVP award during my unforced sabbatical this summer was a bright spot, no question. It reinforced the belief I have in myself - my contributions have value. Microsoft puts this front and center on the award by stating (emphasis mine):</p>   <p class="has-text-align-left"><em>"We <strong>recognize </strong>and <strong>value </strong>your exceptional contributions to technical communities worldwide."</em></p>   <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://thomaslarock.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_9272-449x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-27669"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">I'm running out of room.</figcaption></figure>   <p>I recall the aftermath of my first award, when I was told I was the "least technical SQL Server MVP ever awarded". Talk about feeling you have no value! And that was certainly the feeling I had two months ago. </p>   <p>It's amazing how something as simple as being recognized by your peers can go so far in making a person feel valued. We should all strive to go out of our way daily to help another human feel valued. </p>   <p>There are plenty of people in the world who are recognized as experts in the Microsoft Data Platform. I'd like to think I am one of them. I also happen to be fortunate enough to know Microsoft recognizes me as one as well. </p>   <p>But MVPs advocate for Microsoft because we want to, not because we want an award. After all these years Iâ€™m still crazy for Microsoft, and I am happy to help promote the best data platform on the planet.</p>   <p>For my fellow MVPs renewed this year, I offer this suggestion - say thank you. Then say it again. Email the person on the product team who made the widget you enjoy using over and over and tell them how much you appreciate their effort. Email your MVP lead(s) and thank them for all their hard work as well.</p>   <p>A little kindness goes a long way. You never know how much reaching out could mean to that person at that moment. </p>

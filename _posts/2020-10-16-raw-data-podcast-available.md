<p>When the initial lockdowns were starting in late March, life was a bit confusing as we adjusted. As I felt reality and routine slipping away, I reached out to the one person I knew would help make sense of it all. That person wasn't available, so a week later I sent a text:</p>   <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://thomaslarock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5095-600x278.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20124"/></figure></div>   <p>I've known Rob Collie ever since he <a href="https://thomaslarock.com/2010/06/community-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accosted me ten years ago above a hotel in New Orleans</a>. Since then he and I have had several good, long conversations about data. Our friendship led to one of my favorite data moments. Here Rob tries to convince Dr. Steven Levitt that UFO pilots enjoy LSD, but prefer ecstasy. </p>   <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://thomaslarock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_3709-600x450.jpg" alt="Rob Collie with Dr. Steven Levitt" class="wp-image-20125"/></figure></div>   <p></p>   <p>Rob and I chatted for a while back in April. Our conversation helped me understand a bit more about the changes the world was seeing. We talked about scenarios, and actions to take to protect ourselves and our families. By the end of our chat I felt better. Not great, just better.</p>   <p>Fast forward a few months and I get this text.</p>   <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://thomaslarock.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5096-600x569.jpg" alt="Raw Data text." class="wp-image-20126"/></figure></div>   <p></p>   <p>For ten years or more I have been on the fence about starting a podcast. The timing never felt right. Until I got that text from Rob. This time, I was all in on the idea of Raw Data.</p>   <p>Rob makes this so easy. He's a natural conversationalist. And the guests! Rob knows so many amazing guests. </p>   <p>You can find our homepage here, and the Raw Data podcast itself is on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1VZLfXgz1hcB8MFG2OSOH9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/raw-data-by-p3/id1535636983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, and we have an <a href="https://rawdatabyp3.libsyn.com/rss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RSS feed</a>. </p>   <p>Subscribe and get notified when our next episode drops!</p>

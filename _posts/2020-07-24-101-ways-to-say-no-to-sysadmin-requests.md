<p>As an admin, you often get requests from developers asking for elevated permissions on servers and systems. Inside of SQL Server, this is called '<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sysadmin</a>' access. As you can imagine, it is not a good idea to give this level of access to just anyone. </p>   <p>I thought I would write a post to help you find a way to decline such requests. Because let's face it, when a developer asks for sysadmin access, they are asking if they can go all the way with your database.</p>   <p>So, here they are. As always, youâ€™re welcome.</p>   <p></p>   <ol><li>No</li><li>I'll let you know later</li><li>How about a pizza instead?</li><li>You're not ready</li><li>It's late on a Friday</li><li>I don't do sysadmin</li><li>I don't like you</li><li>I have to go now</li><li>You're just using me</li><li>I'd rather you rub my shoulders</li><li>I can't fix what you'll break</li><li>I'm afraid you'll do something stupid</li><li>This isn't what I had in mind</li><li>I know your reputation</li><li>Let's stop working together for a while</li><li>If you respected me, you wouldn't ask</li><li>I'll get caught</li><li>Is that all you think about?</li><li>I'm allergic to sysadmin</li><li>You'll let everyone use it</li><li>My keyboard is too loud</li><li>It's not worth it</li><li>I'm waiting for the right developer</li><li>It's against my religion</li><li>My boss will kill me</li><li>Let's get something to eat</li><li>I want us to be friends</li><li>I said no and I mean it</li><li>You're too young too handle the admin</li><li>Don't ask me to make this choice</li><li>The sysadmin system is down</li><li>Sysadmin can be more trouble than its worth</li><li>Not everybody has sysadmin, I don't</li><li>With all this ransomware going around?</li><li>Don't make me laugh</li><li>I don't like fixing your mistakes</li><li>I don't just grant sysadmin</li><li>I just got the server built</li><li>Shhh.

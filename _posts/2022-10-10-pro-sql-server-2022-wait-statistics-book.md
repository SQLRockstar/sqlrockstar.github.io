<p>After many months of editing, revising, and writing, my new book <em>Pro SQL Server 2022 Wait Statistics: A Practical Guide to Analyzing Performance in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database</em> is ready for print!</p>   <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://amzn.to/3fQr7hz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://thomaslarock.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pro_sql_server_2022_wait_statictics.jpg" alt="Pro SQL Server 2022 Wait Statistics" class="wp-image-24909"/></a></figure>   <p>You can pre-order here: <a href="https://amzn.to/3fQr7hz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://amzn.to/3fQr7hz</a></p>   <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project, and I want to thank Apress and Jonathan Gennick for giving me the opportunity to update the previous edition. It felt good to be writing again, something I have not been doing enough of lately. And many thanks to Enrico van de Laar (<a href="https://twitter.com/evdlaar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@evdlaar</a>) for giving me amazing content to start with.</p>   <p>The book is an effort to help explain how, why, and when wait events happen. Of course, I also want to show how to solve issues when they arise. Specific wait events are broken down into parts: definition, remediation, and an example. There are plenty of code examples, allowing the reader to duplicate the scenarios to help understand the wait events better. </p>   <p>It is my understanding we will have a GitHub repository for the sample code. This will make it easy for a reader to access the code for their use. I am hoping to keep the repo up to date and expand upon the example as I look towards the next version.</p>   <h2 id="h-pro-sql-server-2022-wait-statistics-at-live-360"><em>Pro SQL Server 2022 Wait Statistics</em> at Live 360!</h2>   <p>I will be presenting material from the book at <a href="https://live360events.com/events/orlando-2022/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SQL Server Live!</a> this November where I have the following sessions, panel discussion, and workshop:</p>   <ul><li>Fast Focus: SQL Server Data Types and Performance</li><li>Locking, Blocking, and Deadlocks</li><li>Performance Tuning SQL Server using Wait Statistics</li><li>SQL Server Live!
